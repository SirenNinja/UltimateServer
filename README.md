UltimateServer
==============

UltimateServer is a Must-Have plugin for your server!

Banned.java was a pain for me because I'm not that smart. Credit goes to sohardhun15 for the correct code.

This was created by SirenNinja. Since this stuff is fairly simple, no point in not releasing the code.
(Damn).

This plugin does contain:

/Banned <player> | Which will tell you if a player is banned or not.
/Feed | Feeds you or another player.
/Fly | Allows you or another player to fly.
/Heal | Heals you or another player.
/opus | I can't even explain this. It's just funny (ops can't use it).
/us | Just a help command.
/UltimateServer | Just a help command.

There will be soooo much more :D.
